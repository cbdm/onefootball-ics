# Onefootball-ICS

This is a webapp to serve the upcoming schedule from a soccer team as an ics calendar.  
The data is parsed from onefootball's fixtures page, and you should be able to import the generated url directly into google calendar.

It is live at [https://onefootball-ics.cbdm.app/](https://onefootball-ics.cbdm.app/)
