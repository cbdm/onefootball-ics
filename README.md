# IMPORTANT!

I think Onefootball made changes recently to their site that broke my scraping.
Instead of trying to fix this issue for now since it could come up later again, I'm developing a new webapp using a different source for data.
So this repository IS UNMAINTAINED if you're reading this message.

You can find the new app at [https://footcal.cbdm.app/](https://footcal.cbdm.app/) and the source at [https://github.com/cbdm/footcal](https://github.com/cbdm/footcal)

## Onefootball-ICS

This is a webapp to serve the upcoming schedule from a soccer team as an ics calendar.  
The data is parsed from onefootball's fixtures page, and you should be able to import the generated url directly into google calendar.

It is live at [https://onefootball-ics.cbdm.app/](https://onefootball-ics.cbdm.app/) and you can check the service status at [status.cbdm.app](https://status.cbdm.app/).
