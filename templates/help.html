    <h2>Team ID</h2>
    This should be the ID for the team in OneFootball.<br/>
    For example, <a href="https://onefootball.com/en/team/atletico-mineiro-1683">https://onefootball.com/en/team/atletico-mineiro-1683</a> goes to the Atlético-MG page.<br/>
    From this URL, we learn the ID for Atlético is "atletico-mineiro-1683".

    <h2>Event Length</h2>
    You can use this option to decide how long each match should be in your calendar.<br/>
    By default, we use 120 minutes for each calendar event. If you want to use this length, you don't need to include it in your URLs.

    <h2>Calendar Integration</h2>
    After you have your team ID and know your event length, you can use the following template to use it in your calendar:<br/>
    {{ url_for('create_team_calendar', team_id='TEAM_ID', event_length='EVENT_LENGTH', _external=True)}}<br/>
    <br/>
    For example, to get the calendar for Atlético's schedule with the default event length you can use:<br/>
    <a href="{{ url_for('create_team_calendar', team_id='atletico-mineiro-1683', _external=True)}}">{{ url_for('create_team_calendar', team_id='atletico-mineiro-1683', _external=True)}}</a><br/>
    <br/>
    Alternatively, you can download the .ics file and manually import it to your calendar.<br/>
    However, that will not automatically be updated, like the URL should be.
